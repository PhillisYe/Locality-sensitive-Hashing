# Locality-sensitive-Hashing

### Learning Objectives

The goal of this project is to investigate Locality-sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework for near neighbor search on real-world datasets.

### Datasets

"cora_all" includes all the documents.  
"cora_query" includes seven query documents.

### Tasks

This project includes generating MinHash functions in the LSH family, constructing LSH hash tables
using Hash functions, performing Nearest Neighbor Search for Query dataset, reporting the list of top-10 documents with highest signature-based Jaccard similarity and bitvector-based Jaccard similarity for each query, and investigating the impact of number of tables and hash size by plotting the search quality in mean reciprocal rank (MRR).
